## Description
This diploma thesis focuses on the analysis and implementation of some basic network coding techinque. We implemented **RLNC**, **LT**, and **BATS codes**, in order to evaluate their performance over different transmission channel models.

The implementation was carried out in **Python**, utilizing the **PyErasure** library for the simulation of encoding and decoding processes.
